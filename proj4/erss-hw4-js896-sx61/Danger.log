1. The server is run in a while loop, so it continuelly consume the CPU resources. In this way, it may lower the performance of the machine.

2. The server is killed by signal, so there is a socket that is not closed.

3. Since the client side is designed as multi-threads client, the client number may reach the limit of TCP accept number.

4. It is possible to run multiple server at the same time, so the client side could send requests to the wrong server.

5. The lower bound should be no larger than upper bound.
